Crop Yield Prediction Using Machin Learning Python

The use of machine learning techniques to forecast crop yield is examined in this work. We make use of a dataset that contains a variety of variables that could affect yield, such as crop type, weather, and geographic data. Several machine learning models are trained and assessed following data cleaning and pre-processing, which includes resolving missing values, converting data formats, and carrying out feature engineering. Decision tree regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and linear regression are some of these models.

The decision tree regression model outperforms the other models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared score on the hold-out test set. Lastly, a prediction function that enables users to enter precise values for the previously mentioned factors and get a projected crop yield is created using the selected model. For later use, the pre-processor and model are also serialized.

This strategy provides a data-driven way for predicting crop yield, which may enable farmers to decide on resource allocation and harvest scheduling with knowledge.
